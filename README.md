Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm

Description:
This project implements the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm in C++. Round Robin is a widely used algorithm in operating systems for process scheduling. It allows each process to execute for a fixed time quantum, and if it is not completed within that time, it is placed back in the ready queue to await execution.

Features:

User-defined number of processes and time quantum.
Input of arrival time and burst time for each process.
Calculation of completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Sorting of processes based on arrival time.
Output display in tabular format including process details and average waiting time.
Usage:

Compilation and Execution:
Navigate to the directory containing RoundRobin.cpp.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler
Run the executable

Using the Program:
When prompted, enter the number of processes and the time quantum.
Input the arrival time and burst time for each process as per the prompts.
The program will calculate and display the completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Finally, it will display the average waiting time.
