# 🔄 Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm

## Description 📜

This project implements the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm in C++. Round Robin is a widely used algorithm in operating systems for process scheduling. It allows each process to execute for a fixed time quantum, and if it is not completed within that time, it is placed back in the ready queue to await execution.

## Features 🌟

- 🖊️ **User-defined** number of processes and time quantum.
- ⏰ **Input of Arrival Time and Burst Time**: For each process.
- 📊 **Metrics Calculation**: Includes completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
- 🗂️ **Sorting of Processes**: Based on arrival time.
- 📈 **Output Display**: In tabular format, including process details and average waiting time.

## Usage 🚀

### Compilation and Execution ⚙️

1. **Navigate to the Directory**: containing `RoundRobin.cpp`.
2. **Compile the Code** using a C++ compiler:
3. **Run the Executable**:


### Using the Program ✍️

1. **Enter Details**: When prompted, input the number of processes and the time quantum.
2. **Input Process Times**: Provide the arrival time and burst time for each process as per the prompts.
3. **View Results**: The program will calculate and display the completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process. Finally, it will display the average waiting time.
